This app was created using `npm init`. `index.js` contains the backend (an in-memory "database"). 

Create a `.env` file (using `.env.sample` as a template). Run using `npm start` or `npm run dev` (dev means that the application will auto restart when any source file changes). Build and deploy using `npm run deploy:full`.
